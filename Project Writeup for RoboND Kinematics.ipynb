    "   1. Failed to start the demo.\n",
    "   I encountered this problem after I have played the demo successfully the first time. As shown in the following screenshots, the system always complains about some invalid launch file or failing to start some local process. \n",
    "   It turns out, that I was using an outdated version of the virtual machine. This problem was gone after I re-downloaded the image and started fresh in V2.1.0.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. Failed to call service calculate_ik.\n",
    "   I encountered this problem after I have completed my IK_server.py code and was ready to test it. The arm will always move randomly and then I noticed this error in the terminal. \n",
    "   The reason, as simple as it was, was that I didn't start the IK server. Everything starts to work after the service was started.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3. Very slow computation\n",
    "   For the first several tests, the calculation inverse kinematics takes forever. A closer examination to the code reveals that, it spent too much time constructing the transform matrix and simplify them. I tried my best to move the constructions outside of the loop, only sub values in inside it. This has increased the speed greatly, but not enough. For a normal pick and place, the inverse kinematics step still take about 10~30 seconds to complete.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   4. The holy Next and the forbidden Continue\n",
    "   When I was testing the arm, I was using the Continue button at first. I never realized that this would actually create a problem. The arm will go to the planned destination and reach the object, close the gripper, but never actually grab it. Then it will act as if it has reached the dropbox and release the object right at the same spot. \n",
    "   I spent way too much time trying to figure out what caused this. After making sure that my code is logically sound, I loaded the demo, and found out in shock that the test demo does exactly the same thing. It was until then that I realized there might be something else besides my code that's causing this problem. \n",
    "   During a session with the expert, I was told that I should never use the Continue button, only the Next. After I switch to use Next button exclusively, this problem was gone immediately. "

    "   1. Speed up the computation\n",
    "   \n",
    "   As I mentioned above, I have tried my best to boost the computation speed, including the code optimization and also allocating more resources for the virtual machine. But more advanced algorithms and data structures, like class and pre constructed matrix, could have better effects on the calculation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. Smoothier movement\n",
    "   Currently, the arm moves in a rough point-to-point process. A better algorithm should produce a much smoothier curve for the movement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3. Real isolation of the position and rotation for the end effector\n",
    "   In current setup of the arm, all the angles for the 6 joints are output to the simulator all the time, which make the last 3 joints moves, in a seemingly random way, all the time. An optimized sequence should be: the first 3 joints will move first, moving the wrist center to its final destination; then the last 3 joints will rotate so that the end effector is at its rightful place.
